Something between an 8 and a 9 would be great! I just hope for a fair grade! 

I listed the activities I did, and included in the end the screen shots of my Public Activity.

10-Asked to be added to specific repositories
11-Followed some of the classmates (some of them might have an interesting update)
12-I created issues on some of the repositories. 
13-I also used issues to creat a path to the images that I uploaded here, probably there is a better way, I will keep exploring. The images are also on the issues
